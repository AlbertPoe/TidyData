I have created one script file which is built in blocks of code each representing a step in the process. 
Each of the blocks are documented inside so that it is clear what is happening. 

The basic outline of the script is as follows.
1.  download and unzip the files
2.  move the files into the same working folder
3.  parse the features file to determine which columns to keep and the column names.
4.  for the test set of files, combine the subject and y files
5.  combine the above file with the test file
6.  repeat the above steps for the train data files
7.  combine these two file into one file
8.  reset the activity names
9.  reset the column names for the variables
10. finally melt and cast the data to summarize the variables by subject and activity

Parts 1 through 4 of the assignment are compleated at step 9 and step ten is required for the final part of the assigment.
